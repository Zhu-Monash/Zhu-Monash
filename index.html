                        <h3>Government expenditure in each state</h3>
                        <p>

                            In terms of expenditure in all states in Australia, New South Wales has the highest
                            proportion,
                            reaching 32.6%.
                            This is followed by Victoria with 24.5%
                            Queensland was third with 19.6%.
                            These three states accounted for 76% of total expenditures</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            NSW expenditures have always accounted for a relatively high proportion of total Australian
                            government expenditures, and the gap with the second and third states has maintained a
                            steady upward trend.</p>

                            The top three expenditure areas are public hospital, medical services, and private hospital,
                            highlighting the government's emphasis on people's health care

                        </h3>
                        <p>


                            In the category of government expenditure, Australian government expenditure accounts for
                            the majority. State government or local government is relatively small.
                            Especially in the field of healthcare, most of them are government-led
